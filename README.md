# Next.js Interview

This is an opportunity for you to showcase your knowledge of `next.js` and
`react`. This is a time-boxed 20 minutes exercise:

- Fetch some blog posts from the database.
- Display them on the page, including:
  - title
  - image
  - created time
  - category
- If you have extra time, implement a simple search for post titles.

You may use any tooling of your choice including Chat GPT, GitHub Copilot, and
reference documentation as you see fit. Feel free to ask as many questions as
you need.
